* Starting point    
  http://drstrangelove.net/2013/12/raspberry-pi-power-cat-feeder-updates/

* GPIO pin outs

  https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio-plus-and-raspi2/

* RPIO python modules for GPIO pins

** original came from here:
   https://github.com/metachris/RPIO
   does not work current with pi 3

** Raspberry pi 3 needs different RPIO used:
   git clone https://github.com/limuxy/RPIO
   need to be root import RPIO
   python setup.py build
   sudo python setup.py install
   
* TODO  WIFI set up 
  For now, ran ethernet cable to work bench
  rpi ip address 192.168.2.161  for ethernet, manually assigned in router

  wireless set up described here:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md

* Raspberry Pi and servos
  https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-8-using-a-servo-motor/hardware

** Technical details of servo:

   https://www.adafruit.com/products/154

   Operating Voltage: 4.8V~6V (5V works best)
   Average Speed: ~0.18sec/60Â°
   Stall Torque (4.8V): 3kg.cm/41.74oz.in
   Stall Torque (6V): 3.2kg.com/44.52oz.in
   Required Pulse: 500us-2500us
   Connector Wire Length: 30cm / 11.8"
   Dimensions: 37mm x 54mm x 20mm / 1.5" x 2.1" x 0.8"
   Weight (no horns): 40g
   Spline Count: 25

** attach servo power with common ground as signal line

** code for testing - must run GPIO commands as root with sudo

#+begin_src python

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

servo1Pin = 18

GPIO.setup(servo1Pin,GPIO.OUT)
servo1 = GPIO.PWM(servo1Pin,50) # 50 is pulse frequency in Hz
servo1.start(10.5)              # 10.5 is duty cycle of pulse on 
time.sleep(10.)
servo1.stop()

# when done, do this to clear GPIO settings.
GPIO.cleanup()
